   rubric:: RISK MANAGEMENT :name: risk-management

   1. ..
      rubric:: OVERVIEW :name: overview

..

   Risk Management is the process of hazard identification, risk assessment and control.\ |Hazelm008|

   The purpose is to mitigate potentially negative outcomes or hazards associated with the performance of tasks and activities on site.

   Hazards are present in all tasks and must be identified competently.
   Several tools are used in identifying hazards.

   The Identified hazard is then added to the **Site Risk Register (SRR)**.

   The Site Risk Register applies risk assessment principles to each hazard and controls which are required by this plan.
   The residual risk determines how activities which have these hazards need to be managed.

   A risk assessment process following the principles of this Section shall be used to determine the level of risk and the effect of controls.
   Given the varied nature of tasks in construction, from simple fitting tasks up to complex lifts, one or more of SWMS, JHA or Take 5 shall be used.

RISK ASSESSMENT PRINCIPLES
--------------------------

   100% of all activities on site require Risk Assessment prior to commencement.
   This section covers the principles to be used including the Risk Matrix and the Hierarchy of Controls for risk mitigation.
   The following section then covers the Risk Assessment Tools to be used that utilise these principles.

Risk Matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~

   For this Project the following Risk Matrix is used.

HAZARD IDENTIFICATION & SITE RISK REGISTER (SRR)
------------------------------------------------

   Hazards are present in all tasks and must first be identified and registered.
   Tools used by this Project to identify Hazards present include:

Construction Risk Assessment Workshop (CRAW)
--------------------------------------------

   See below

Hazard Observations (HAZOB)
---------------------------

   See below

   Training, consultation and monitoring shall also be provided to ensure that hazards can and are correctly identified for tasks to be completed.
   These processes shall include:

Site Based Inductions
---------------------

   Refer Section 5.2

.. _toolbox-meetings-1:

Toolbox Meetings
----------------

   Refer Section 5.4

.. _workplace-inspections-1:

Workplace Inspections
---------------------

   Refer Section 5.5

Workplace Safety Audits
-----------------------

   Refer Section 5.8

   A pre-mobilisation **Construction Risk Assessment Workshop (CRAW)** has been conducted by the Anergy design and construction team.
   This assessment process:

a) Used keywords for potential hazards.

b) Identified potential causes for such hazards to exist.

c) Determined using the Risk Matrix in Section 6.2 the Risk of Works.

d) Identified Risk Reduction actions required for this Safety Plan; and

e) Determined the Residual Risk remaining of the hazard.

..

   The results of the CRAW have formed the **Site Risk Register (SRR)**.

   Where new hazards are identified which are not already captured in the SRR (for example, through HAZOB or other risk assessment activities), a team
   shall complete steps b) through (e) above, and the results shall be appended to the SRR.

   In assessing any tasks to be performed through processes such as T5RA, JHA, SWMS or otherwise (see further below), the SRR shall be consulted to
   understand the safety plan control measures and residual risks of hazards involved.

   It must be noted, however, that consulting the SRR in this way *does not* substitute the necessary T5RA, JHA or SWMS processes.

RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS
---------------------

   Given the varied nature of tasks in construction, from simple fitting tasks up to complex lifts, the tool(s) used to properly assess the task will be
   one of the following:

Safe Work Method Statements (SWMS)
----------------------------------

   Refer Section 6.5

Job Hazard Analysis (JHA)
-------------------------

   Refer Section 6.6

‘Take 5’ Risk Assessment (T5RA)
-------------------------------

   Refer Section 6.7

   It is expected that prior to commencement of any risk assessment process the supervisory team shall plan all activities associated with a task to
   clearly inform this process.

   The tool to be used shall depend on the hazards identified for the activity and tasks at hand.
   It shall be acceptable to conduct a **Take 5 Risk Assessment (T5RA)** if

-  The hazards identified are also registered in the SRR.

-  The residual risk of these hazards, as registered in the SRR, is *L* *OW*; and

-  The task involves a maximum of two (2) people.

..

   In all other cases, a **Job Hazard Analysis (JHA)** shall be required just before commencement on site of any work relating to the activity at hand,
   regardless of whether the activity also has a SWMS.

   A **Safe Work Method Statement (SWMS)** shall be completed prior to commencement under any of the following circumstances.

-  The risk or residual risk of any hazard registered in the SRR is HIGH or EXTREME.

-  Where the activity is classified, per OSH Regulations Reg 3.137, as being ‘high-risk construction activity’.
  Such activities of particular relevance to this project include:

   -  Construction work involving a risk of a person falling 2m or more.

   -  Construction work involving a confined space; and

   -  Construction work on or near energised electrical installations and lines.

-  Whenever the Site Manager requests one be performed.

.. _safe-work-method-statements-swms-1:

SAFE WORK METHOD STATEMENTS (SWMS)
----------------------------------

   A SWMS is prepared by those that have expertise in the activity to be completed.
   A final site review will be undertaken in the form of the JHA.

   The SWMS is applicable for the duration of the activity or activities listed.
   However, it may be necessary through the JHA process to update and improve if conditions change over the course of the activity.

   The SWMS shall clearly identify:

A. The person(s) signed on to the SWMS.

B. The type of work to be completed.

C. What equipment and materials are needed.

D. What personnel and competencies are required.

E. Description of how the work is carried out.

F. What tasks have hazards.

G. What these hazards are.

H. What control measures will be applied to tasks; and

I. How and by whom these control measures will be applied.

..

   Under step F and G, the risk management principles Section 6.4 shall apply including the Risk Matrix and Hierarchy of Control.
   Where an alternate Risk Matrix is applied, the Site Manager shall determine if this is acceptable or not.

   Anergy has a standard SWMS form but those submitted by Subcontractors or Service Providers shall be considered satisfactory if the Site Manager
   approves that they identify the information above.

   Any SWMS used on the Project must be lodged with the Construction Office and added to the Safety File.
   Any currently used SWMS statements shall be made available to all workers.

.. _job-hazard-analysis-jha-1:

JOB HAZARD ANALYSIS (JHA)
-------------------------

   A Job Hazard Analysis (JHA) shall be required immediately prior to the start of any new activity or on the restart of any activity.
   The exception is as discussed in Section 6.4 where a T5RA to begin with shall be acceptable.

   The JHA shall prepared by all workers, supervisors and managers who will be directly involved in the activity.
   It shall be completed on the day of the work and shall only be applicable for the duration of that day.
   This is to ensure that any changes in the environment, personnel, site or other externalities are captured.

   Where the JHA is performed on activities covered by a SWMS, the JHA shall refer to that SWMS and its tasks and controls therein.

   The JHA shall clearly identify:

A. The actual work to be completed.

B. Actual equipment and materials which will be used.

C. Names and roles of personnel who will be involved including who will supervise.

D. Step by step description of how the work will be carried out.

E. What steps have hazards.

F. What these hazards are.

G. What control measures will be applied to specific steps; and

H. Who will take responsibility for the control measures?

..

   Under step E and F, the Risk Management principles Section 6.4 shall apply including the Risk Matrix and Hierarchy of Control.

   Anergy has a standard JHA form which shall be used.
   All workers must sign on to the JHA before being able to participate in the activity.
   Changes in roles must also be recorded if they occur during the day.

   All JHA’s must be approved by the identified Supervisor before commencing work.
   A copy of the JHA must remain in the Construction Office and will on completion of the day be added to the Safety File.

.. _take-5-risk-assessment-t5ra-1:

TAKE 5 RISK ASSESSMENT (T5RA)
-----------------------------

   Take 5 is a risk assessment tool in the form of a notebook to be carried by all workers.
   Books are issued at the pre-start meeting and need to be returned to the construction office on the completion of each day.

   All workers will be trained in the use of the T5RA tool during the Site Induction.

   It is expected that workers shall complete T5RA assessments at the start and restart of work during the day.

   The quality of T5RA shall be a key performance indicator.

7. ..
   rubric:: TRAINING :name: training

   1. ..
      rubric:: TRAINING MATRIX :name: training-matrix

..

   Work to be carried out on site shall often require workers have completed particular training or be able to demonstrate particular competency.
   Additionally, individual positions or roles shall have a prescribed set of training as a minimum requirement for acting in that role on site.

   To easily identify the required training for each role, and the training held by each individual worker, the training matrix shall be established to
   capture these requirements.
   Each individual item of training or competency shall be graded according to the following nomenclature.

   Code *Y* Achieved

   Code *R* Required, but not achieved

   Code *T* Training currently in progress, but not yet achieved

   Code *D* Not necessarily required; not achieved; desirable (optional) Code X Not required and not achieved

   Four classifications of training shall be established:

1. Formal qualifications, including tertiary and trade qualifications (e.g. electrician; engineering degree).

2. Internal training and demonstrable competencies (e.g. forklift competency.

3. comprehension of this safety plan).

4. Work-specific and high-risk work licenses, as formal licenses pertaining to specific work tasks (e.g. rigging licenses; crane operator licenses; EWP
   license); and

5. Nationally recognised training (e.g. construction white card; first aid certificate).

..

   The individual items of training or competency under each classification shall be subsequently developed according to the specific construction works
   to be carried out.

   Evidence of worker training, certification, etc.
   shall be captured, recorded, and stored in Anergy head office.
   The training matrix shall be correspondingly maintained to ensure its currency and accuracy.
   Sensitive documents shall be stored in a locked cabinet with limited access.

   When assigning work tasks to individuals, managers, supervisors and workers shall together consult the training matrix to ensure currency and adequacy
   of a worker’s training for the particular task.
   Where a gap is identified, the parties shall consult and report to the site manager

   to close the gap without compromising safe work.

   Where training may expire the expiry date of any license shall be taken and recorded in the training matrix.

CONSTRUCTION INDUCTION TRAINING
-------------------------------

   All Workers on site must either be holders of a current Western Australian Construction White (or Blue) Card.
   Random checks of White/Blue card validity will be conducted, and all workers on site will be made available of these checks.

   White/Blue cards shall be recorded in accordance with Section 7.1 at the time of site induction to ensure that all personnel are fully inducted.

SITE SPECIFIC INDUCTIONS
------------------------

   Inductions shall be conducted by either the Site Manager prior to the commencement of work by Workers (see also Consultation and Reporting and Site
   Rules - Visitors).

   All inductions shall be recorded and signed by both the Worker and the Inductor.
   Records shall be kept in the Site Office.

WORK-SPECIFIC TRAINING REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------

   The following section lists typical licenses that shall be held by workers in order to complete specific activities.
   This list shall be neither prescriptive nor exhaustive and shall be adapted in the formulation of the training matrix according to the requirements of
   the project.

-  Australian Driver’s License – driving any vehicle on site.

-  WorkSafe WA-recognised High Risk Work License, for any high-risk activity including.
